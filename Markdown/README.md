# AIC DISCOVERY

The purpose of this application is for viewers to discover the Art Institute of Chicago's collection.
  
Users chose between three centuries: 18th, 19th, or 20th Century. The app will then show users different artwork from the chosen century, and the user can like/dislike the artwork.  

There is a Favorites category, this is where a user will find their liked artwork.

The Suprise Me category showcases artwork from a century NOT chosen by the user.
